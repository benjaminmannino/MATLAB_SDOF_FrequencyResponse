# MATLAB_SDOF_FrequencyResponse
## Solves and plots two different types of springs' frequency responses.

## Overview
This project uses an MATLAB to solve and plot the frequency responses of a standard spring and an electromagnetic "spring".

## Features
- Language: MATLAB
- Solves frequency response equations for multiple frequencies at set values.
- Plots both frequency responses together for easy comparison. 

## Files
- `3000L_Version_5.ino` — main MATLAB code  
- `SDOF_Plot` — graph outputted from code
- `README.md` — project explanation
- `LICENSE` — license information 

## Lessons Learned
Plotting multiple variables simultaneously, solving equations in for/while loop, troubleshooting in MATLAB.
